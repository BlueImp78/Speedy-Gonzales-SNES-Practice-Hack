# Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos practice hack
A practice romhack for the Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos speedrun.
It has features such as selectable categories, level select menu, checkpoint reloading and more. See below for full feature list.

## How to patch

- Apply the .ips patch to your vanilla Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos (U, v1.1) ROM with the included Lunar IPS program. 
- Enjoy.


## Features
  
- The game's intro movie and logos are skipped, world map and mice cage cutscene before entering a stage are skipped.

- Selectable categories in the title screen (Any% or 100%).

- Amount of hearts/max hearts set for each checkpoint/stage based on the chosen route (as well as mice count for 100%)

- On-screen mice counter for the 100% route.

- Mices will be caged again in the 100% route when reloading a checkpoint so you can collect them again.

- 99 Lives that refill on changing stages/checkpoints.

- At any point in a level, with the X button held, use the D-Pad to cycle forward/backwards through checkpoints, or press SELECT to reload the current checkpoint you're in.

- At any point in the level, pause the game to access the level select menu. From there you can select which stage and which "act" of the stage to warp to, including bosses.

## Known Issues

- When warping to stage 7-2, the player death sound effect plays.
- You may run into one or two graphical glitches here and there, I did my best to prevent this but this game is pretty unstable.

## Special Thanks

- Zewing for commissioning me to make this hack, and Zekinoma for providing necessary route info and playtesting.
